Under the Building Energy Benchmarking Program, calculate your energy use intensity by dividing your energy use by the square footage of your building. That number will act as a baseline to compare the efficiency of your building to that of previous years or to those of similar buildings.\n\nWhat Is the Value of an Energy Benchmark?\n\nConducting an energy benchmark helps measure the performance of your building and lets you know how efficient or inefficient it may be. A significant portion of a company\u2019s operating expenses goes toward energy bills. Energy efficiency improvements may reduce these costs substantially.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Benchmarking?\n\nBenchmarking can help prioritize energy-efficient investments and track energy efficiency improvements over time.\n\nWhat Is an ENERGY STAR\u00ae Score?\n\nThe ENERGY STAR score is a 1 to 100 score that demonstrates the energy efficiency of a building relative to similar buildings across the country. A score of 50 indicates the national average energy performance for that building type. A score of 75 or higher means the building is a top performer and may be eligible for ENERGY STAR certification.\u00a0\u00a0Not all building types are eligible for an ENERGY STAR score, and an ENERGY STAR score is not required for compliance with this program.\n\nBuilding Energy Benchmarking Program Summary\n\nExpand All\nCollapse All\n\nWhat Is the Building Energy Benchmarking Program?\n\nThe Building Energy Benchmarking Program is the state\u2019s program to publicly disclose the energy use of buildings in California.\n\nWhen Does It Take Effect?\n\nMandatory reporting began in 2018 for buildings with no residential units and more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area, and in 2019 for buildings with 17 or more residential units and more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area. Reporting is due by June 1 annually.\n\nWhat If My City or County Already Has a Benchmarking Reporting Requirement?\n\nThe state regulations allow for buildings reported under a local benchmarking program to be exempted from reporting to the state. Any programs that have received such an exemption will be listed on the California Energy Commission\u2019s\u202fExempted Local Benchmarking Ordinances\u00a0page. For buildings in jurisdictions with programs listed on this page, benchmarking and reporting to the local jurisdiction will fulfill compliance with the state program.\nAlthough your building might be exempt from a local reporting requirement, you may still be required to report to the state.\n\nWhat Is the Procedure to Protect Proprietary Energy Use Data?\n\nWhen (1) the building owner is the customer of record for the only utility account serving a building, or (2) the building owner is one of two customers of record if the other customer has granted permission to have his or her energy use data shared, the owner may request a trade secret exemption from the executive director of the Energy Commission. If this exemption is granted, the building owner will be required to report building characteristic information but not energy use data.\n\nWhere Can I Get More Information?\n\nThe Energy Commission\u2019s\u00a0benchmarking page, www.energy.ca.gov/benchmarking.\n\nCompliance Requirements\n\nExpand All\nCollapse All\n\nAm I Required to Comply?\n\nYou are required to comply if your building has (1) more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area and (2) either no residential units or 17+ residential units. These are considered \u201cdisclosable\u201d buildings.\n\nWhat Does Gross Floor Area Include?\n\nThe gross floor area includes all square footage within the exterior walls of the building.\n\nWhat Are the Exemptions to the Reporting Requirement?\n\nYou are not required to report to the Energy Commission if:\n\nYour building is a condominium, as described in Section 4125 or 6542 of the California Civil Code.\nYour building has between 1 and 16 residential utility accounts.\nYour building did not have a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy for more than half of the calendar year for which reporting to the Energy Commission is required.\nYour building is scheduled to be demolished one year or less from the reporting date.\nYour building has more than half of the gross floor area used for scientific experiments requiring a controlled environment or for manufacturing or industrial purposes.\nYour building was benchmarked under a local program listed on the\u00a0CEC\u2019s exempted local benchmarking ordinances.\n\nI Am the New Owner of a Building. Am I Required to Report Energy Use Data From Before I Owned the Building?\n\nYes, the owner of the building at the time of the reporting deadline (June 1) is responsible for submitting energy use data. Utilities are required to provide energy use information to a building\u2019s current owner regardless of who owned the building during the period for which data is being reported.\n\nHow Do Building Owners Determine Building Type?\n\nBuilding types are defined by how the building is used. For example, a building classified as industrial but used for storage should be identified as storage rather than industrial for reporting purposes.\nFor additional guidance, building owners can refer to the\u00a0ENERGY STAR Property Types in Portfolio Manager.\u00a0\n\nWhat Is Considered Industrial?\n\nIndustrial purposes include manufacturing and assembling goods. Warehouses and distribution centers are not considered industrial and are required to comply.\n\nDo I Need to Comply If My Building Is Mixed-Use With Both Industrial and Office Uses?\n\nIf your building has more than 50 percent of the gross floor area used for industrial or manufacturing purposes, you are not required to report.\nOtherwise, you should benchmark your building with multiple uses. ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager allows you to assign multiple space use types to a single building.\n\nIs Compliance Required for Distribution Centers?\n\nYes.\n\nIs Compliance Required for Historic Buildings?\n\nYes.\n\nIs Compliance Required for Government-Owned Buildings?\n\nYes. However, buildings owned by the federal government are outside the jurisdiction of this program.\n\nIs Compliance Required for Strip Malls or Open-Air Shopping Centers?\n\nCompliance is required for each building that has more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area. Separate buildings that appear to be a single building due to a continuous fa\u00e7ade should be treated as individual buildings. If a single building within a strip mall or open-air shopping center encompasses more than 50,000 square feet, then compliance is required for that building.\n\nDoes My Building Square Footage Include Parking Areas?\n\nCovered parking structures should be included, while uncovered parking lots should be excluded.\u00a0When entering your gross floor area into your Portfolio Manager account, there is a separate field for parking, so you can separate the parking area from the building area.\u00a0\n\nHow Do I Comply?\n\nThere are five general steps required to comply:\n\nOpen an account in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.\nEnter each disclosable building into your account.\nEnter the energy use data for each disclosable building.\nClick the appropriate reporting link on the\u00a0CEC\u2019s Report Benchmarking Data\u00a0page, which will direct you to log in to Portfolio Manager.\u00a0\nSubmit your report from within Portfolio Manager.\n\nWhen Do I Need to Comply?\n\nReporting is due by June 1 annually.\n\nWill I Need to Complete This Each Year?\n\nYou will need to resubmit your building each year. After the first year you report, much of the information you are reporting will remain the same. So you will just need to check for information that may have changed, enter the energy use data for the previous calendar year, and submit your report.\n\nWhat Is the Cost of Complying?\n\nThere is no fee to report your data to the Energy Commission, and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager is a free online tool. However, you may wish to hire a consultant to perform the benchmarking and reporting for you.\n\nWho Can Prepare the Report and Send the Data?\n\nAnyone authorized by the building owner may request energy use data from a utility, benchmark a building, and submit the report to the Energy Commission.\n\nCan You Benchmark My Building?\n\nThe Energy Commission cannot benchmark and report your building. You may hire a consultant to complete the process for you.\n\nDo I Need to Load Our Information Into ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager If I Use  Different Energy Management Software?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat Resources Can Help Me Comply?\n\nThe\u00a0CEC\u2019s Building Energy Benchmarking Program\u00a0page includes step-by-step guides and videos under the resources section. You can also contact the CEC\u2019s\u00a0Benchmarking Hotline\u00a0at\u00a0Benchmarking@energy.ca.gov\u00a0or (855) 279-6460. For questions about or training on ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, please visit the\u00a0ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager Training page.\n\nI Received A Letter From A Company That Says I Am Delinquent On My Benchmarking Submission. Did You Send This Letter?\n\nLetters regarding benchmarking only come from the CEC\u2019s address (current: 715 P Street, Sacramento, CA 95814 / previous: 1516 9th\u00a0Street, Sacramento, CA 95814). If you receive correspondence and are unsure if it is legitimate, contact the Benchmarking Hotline at Benchmarking@energy.ca.gov or (855) 279-6460. A picture or a scanned copy of the letter may be requested. \nIf you have a compliance obligation but have not yet submitted your building, submit your data as soon as possible, even if it is after the reporting deadline. If you are unsure whether you have a compliance obligation, contact the Benchmarking Hotline at Benchmarking@energy.ca.gov or (855) 279-6460.\n\nHow Do I Know If the Report Has Been Submitted?\n\nAfter submitting the report, you will receive a confirmation email from ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.\n\nWhat Is the Penalty for Not Complying?\n\nThe Energy Commission has the authority to issue fines for noncompliance, after allowing a 30-day period to correct a violation. Building owners who have missed the June 1 reporting deadline are urged to report as soon as possible.\n\nWho Is Responsible for Reporting a Building That Is Jointly Owned?\n\nAll owners in a joint ownership are responsible for reporting, but the Energy Commission needs to receive only one report for the building. ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager has the ability to assign multiple owners to a property, which allows all owners to access the property and make needed changes. Joint owners may wish to appoint one owner (for example, the owner of the largest portion of the building) to complete reporting.\n\nWhat Proof Is Needed to Use the Reporting Link Property Report Without Energy Data?\n\nThe Energy Commission does not require proof at this time. However, please keep the notification received from the utility indicating the customers were either not responsive or denied permission.\u00a0\n\nWhat If My Building Units Are Not Individually Metered?\n\nEach residential unit is considered a utility account for compliance, whether the unit is directly metered or on a master meter. Any master-metered building that has more than 50,000 square feet of gross floor area and has 17 or more residential units is required to comply.\n\nWhat If My Property Has Multiple Buildings?\n\nThe regulations require reporting at the building level, when possible.\u00a0However, properties with multiple buildings that meet all the following should be reported as a single building:\n\nTwo or more buildings on the same parcel or adjacent parcels\nAt least one energy meter shared between buildings\nTotal gross floor area of more than 50,000 square feet in the buildings that share a meter\n17 or more residential utility accounts*\n\nIf you wish to track energy use on a more granular level at your property with multiple buildings, you may create a parent property in Portfolio Manager and include individual buildings under it using the campus feature. However, benchmarking results should be reported at the property level to ensure that results capture the energy use of all shared meters and central systems.\u00a0\n*For multifamily properties, each residential unit is considered a utility account for compliance, whether the unit is directly metered or master metered.\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Portfolio Manager and Requesting Energy Use Data\n\nExpand All\nCollapse All\n\nDo I need to make any changes to my benchmarking information due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed the way many buildings in the United States operate.\u00a0ENERGY STAR assessed the impact of these changes on the 1-100 ENERGY STAR scores and has updated some of their guidance for energy use in commercial buildings. The guidance will allow more opportunities to apply for ENERGY STAR Certification.Also modified are some ENERGY STAR Certification rules.\u00a0\n\nWhat Does Portfolio Manager Allow You To Do?\n\nPortfolio Manager can be used to track and analyze energy and water consumption in your buildings, generate weather-normalized energy use intensity and greenhouse gas emissions metrics, generate a 1 to 100 ENERGY STAR score for many building types, and compare your building to other buildings in your portfolio and to similar buildings nationwide.\n\nWhat Energy Sources Must Be Reported?\n\nElectricity, natural gas, steam, and fuel oil consumption are required. However, Portfolio Manager also includes fields for propane and other energy sources that you can input and track.\n\nWhat Fields Are Required?\n\nBasic property details such as address, total gross floor area, occupancy, and year built are required in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, along with 12 months of energy use data. Water and waste data are not required. The most important fields to verify are gross floor area and energy use data. If you do not have accurate values for other fields, you can use default or approximate values.To streamline the process, you can download a\u00a0Portfolio Manager data collection worksheet\n\nIs an ENERGY STAR Score Required for Reporting?\n\nNo. Not all building types are eligible for an ENERGY STAR score.\n\nDo I Need a Building Identification Number From the Energy Commission to Report My Building?\n\nBeginning in 2023, the Energy Commission added a benchmarking reference number to allow for tracking the tens of thousands of disclosable buildings. This unique value will remain the same every year and matches the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager reporting with the building record.To complete your submission, please follow these instructions to add the benchmarking reference number and resubmit the benchmarking report.Go to\u00a0https://benchmarkingca.com/.Search for the building\u2019s street address in the \u2018Street\u2019 field.In the table that populates, find the building street address in the column titled \u2018Street.\u2019The benchmarking reference number is in the first column on the left titled \u2018Reference #.\u2019Log in to ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager and, from the Dashboard, click on the property to add its benchmarking reference number.Navigate to the \u2018Details\u2019 tab.Scroll down to \u2018Unique Identifiers (IDs)\u2019 box on the left and click \u2018Edit.\u2019Scroll to the bottom and find \u2018Standard ID(s).\u2019 From the drop-down menu select California Building ID and enter the corresponding benchmarking reference number.Click \u2018Save.\u2019You only need to add the benchmarking reference number once. After saving, all future reports submitted for this property will include the number.\u00a0If you already have a local program ID from an\u00a0exempted local benchmarking ordinance\u00a0you will not add a California Building ID/Benchmarking Reference Number.If you have any questions regarding finding your benchmarking reference number, or how to bring your building into compliance, contact the benchmarking call center at\u00a0benchmarking@energy.ca.gov\u00a0or (855) 279-6460.\n\nHow Do I Report Buildings 50,000 Square Feet or Smaller?\n\nReporting is not required for buildings with 50,000 square feet or less of gross floor area, except when a meter serves multiple buildings with a total gross floor area greater than 50,000 square feet. In that case, the property should be reported as a single building.\n\nWhat Should I Do If My Utility Does Not Upload Energy Data to Portfolio Manager?\n\nYou can either 1) insert energy totals from your utility bills directly on the website or 2) use the upload template of Portfolio Manager to add data in bulk.This ENERGY STAR document walks through the three methods of uploading data: How to Get Utility Data into Portfolio Manager - PDF.\n\nMy Bill Cycles Do Not Align With The Beginning And End Of Each Month. Do I Need To Modify My Dates Before Entering Data?\n\nEnter the dates the utility provides without any adjustment. If the data you enter includes the entire required period (typically the previous calendar year), Portfolio Manager will use the data that is needed to benchmark your building.\n\nHow Do I Enter Meter Data If My Building Uses or Produces Renewable Energy?\n\nYou can track the renewable energy as a separate meter in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.\n\nHow Do I Benchmark My Building If It Was Recently Occupied and Does Not Have 12 Months of Data?\n\nYour building is exempt from reporting if it did not have a permanent or temporary certificate of occupancy for more than half of the calendar year being reported. Otherwise, reporting is required, so include the energy use data you have.\n\nHow Can I Get Whole-Building Data From the Utility?\n\nYou will need to provide an attestation that you are the building owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner. Proof of ownership is not required.\n\nIs There a Form to Request Data as a Building Owner or Owner\u2019s Agent? \n\nNo. Utilities have their own processes for requesting energy use data.\u00a0\n\nDo I Need to Request Data for Retail Tenants Who Pay Their Own Electricity Bills?\n\nYes, whole-building data is required, including tenant-owned/managed spaces.\n\nWhat If I Cannot Get Customer Permission to Obtain Energy Use Data?\n\nIf there are three or more utility customers in the building, utilities are required to provide whole-building energy use data without requiring customer permission.\n\nI Received Energy Use Data From the Utility That Seems Incorrect. How Can I Verify The Accuracy of the Data I Received?\n\nBegin by verifying that the energy meters used by the utility to calculate your building\u2019s energy use are correctly matched to your building. When a utility provides energy use data, they are also required to provide the last four characters of the meter number(s) serving the building. If the meter numbers provided are incorrect for your building, notify the utility of your meter numbers and request corrected data.If the meter numbers match and you still believe the data is incorrect, and you have utility bills from the requested period, compare the bills to what was provided by the utility. If these do not match, contact the utility for assistance.\n\nWhat Should I Do If a Utility Has Not Responded To My Request for Energy Use Data by the Deadline?\n\nBy the reporting deadline, if you have not received energy use data from your utility or are unable to access your utility account to gather information, submit your building information to the CEC using the link titled \u201cUse this link to report ____ (reporting year) information if energy use data is unavailable\u201d on the\u00a0Report Benchmarking Data\u00a0page.\u00a0When you receive the data for your building, resubmit the building information using the link \u201cUse this link to report ____ (reporting year) energy use data.\u201d The later submittal will replace the earlier one.\u00a0If the link titled \u201cUse this link to report ____ (reporting year) information if energy use data is unavailable\u201d is not present for a given reporting year, use the link \u201cUse this link to report ____ (reporting year) energy use data.\u201d to submit without energy use data and resubmit with energy use data when it becomes available.\n\nI Have Submitted Incorrect Information. Does My Old Submission Need to be Removed Prior to Completing a New Submission?\n\nIf the Portfolio Manager ID stays the same (this will be the case if you re-submit the building from the same Portfolio Manager account), your new submission will automatically replace your previous submission.\n\nHow Do I Check or Validate Data on ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager?\n\nPortfolio Manager includes a data quality checker. The regulations require the checker to be run before submitting your building to the Energy Commission. Portfolio Manager will also flag certain types of errors automatically. Please review your report before submitting it.\n\nDoes the Energy Commission Have Any Recommendations About How To Make the Data Tracking Process Easier?\n\nYour utility may offer recurring automatic upload of energy use data to your Portfolio Manager account so you don\u2019t have to request the energy use data annually.\n\nHow Do I Report Energy Consumption If I Have Metered Solar Generation Onsite? \n\nIn Portfolio Manager, create a meter for solar and fill in the Energy Used On Site and the Energy Exported Offsite sections.\n\nHow Do I Report If I Have Solar Generation Onsite but Have Only Estimated Production Data?\n\nIn Portfolio Manager, create a meter for solar and fill in the estimated Energy Used On Site and the Energy Exported Offsite sections and indicate that it is an estimate.\n\nHow Do I Report If I Have Solar Generation Onsite but There Are No Production or Estimated Production Data?\n\nIn Portfolio Manager, create a meter for solar and fill in zero as the estimated Energy Used On Site and the Energy Exported Offsite sections and indicate that it is an estimate.\n\nIs Water Required for Reporting?\n\nNo, water is not required for reporting. It is optional.\n\nIs Waste Required for Reporting?\n\nNo, waste is not required for reporting. It is optional.\n\nThe Data Quality Checker Says Meter or Data for Water and/or Waste is Not Available. Are They Supposed to be Reported?\n\nNo, you do not have to report water or waste data, both are optional. You may submit your report without water or waste data.\n\nMy Building is Located within an Exempted Local Benchmarking Ordinance, Do I Need a Benchmarking Reference Number?\n\nNo, you do not need to add a benchmarking reference number if your building(s) is located within an\u00a0exempted local benchmarking ordinance.In situations, where you are not required to comply with the local ordinance, but are still required to comply with the State\u2019s Building Energy Benchmarking Program, you need a\u00a0benchmarking reference number. It is recommended to first check with your local jurisdiction.\n\nMy Building Already has an Existing Standard ID. Do I Still Need a Benchmarking Reference Number?\n\nIf your building is located within an\u00a0exempted local benchmarking ordinance\u00a0and that program has its own ID, you do not need to add a benchmarking reference number. If your building is outside an exempted local benchmarking ordinance and you are reporting to the Energy Commission, you must add a benchmarking reference number.\n\nPublic Disclosure\n\nExpand All\nCollapse All\n\nWhat Is Being Done With Information From the Program? \n\nThe first year of data for each group of disclosable buildings (2018 for buildings with no residential accounts, and 2019 for buildings with 17 or more residential utility accounts) will not be publicly disclosed. Beginning in the second year for each group, the Energy Commission will disclose selected information for reported buildings on a public website. This will allow current and prospective building owners and tenants to better understand the buildings in which they live and work.\n\nIs the Public Reporting Intended to Shame High Energy Users?\n\nThe information will help current and prospective building owners and occupants make better-informed decisions about purchasing, leasing, maintenance, and upgrades.\n\nAre There Penalties for High Energy Use?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat Information Will Be Public?\n\nThe Energy Commission may make available:\u00a0\n\nBuilding address, including county, latitude, and longitude.\u00a0\nYear built.\nGross floor area and property floor area (buildings and parking).\nProperty or building name, if any.\nOpen comments field for the building owner or owner\u2019s agent to provide additional information about the building.\nENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager property ID.\nPercentage of space occupied (occupancy) and number of occupants.\nNumber of buildings (if served by one common energy meter without submetering).\nENERGY STAR score for eligible buildings.\nMonthly or annual site or source energy use by energy type or a combination.\nMonthly or annual weather-normalized site or source energy use intensity or a combination.\nMonthly or annual peak electricity demand or both.\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHow do I claim my building found on benchmarkingca.com?\n\nTo claim, please fill out this form.\u00a0 Upon CEC review and approval, your contact information will be associated with the building and you will receive email compliance notifications, reminders and more for the building.\n\n  Building Energy Benchmarking Program\n  \n\nBenchmarking - Building Owner Energy Efficiency Resources\n\nBuilding Energy Benchmarking Program Frequently Asked Questions\n\nExempted Local Benchmarking Ordinances\n\nLocal Government Benchmarking Toolkit\n\nReport Benchmarking Data\n\nContact\n\nBenchmarking Hotline\nbenchmarking@energy.ca.gov\n855-279-6460\n\nSubscribe\n\nBuilding Energy Use Benchmarking and Public Disclosure Program\n\nEmail\n\nPlease enter your email address.\n\nLeave this field blank\n\n  \n\nCategories\n\n  \n\nTopic\n\n  Efficiency\n\nDivision\n\n  Efficiency\n\nProgram\n\n  Building Energy Benchmarking Program\n\nContact\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission\n715 P Street\nSacramento, CA 95814\nContact Us | Directions\u00a0\nLanguage Services\n\u00a0\n\nCareers\n\nCome be part of creating a clean, modern and thriving California.\nLearn more about Careers\n\nCampaigns\n\nRegister to Vote\nBe Counted, California\nEnergy Upgrade California\nSave Our Water\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n"}
