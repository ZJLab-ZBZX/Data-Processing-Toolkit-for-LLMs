To make it easy for your employees to find and book the\u00a0resources they need, it is best practice to add as much detail as possible. Your users will see details like the building and floor where a room or resource is located, and the key features, such as video conferencing equipment or whiteboards\nStep 1: Add buildings\nStart by listing all the buildings in your company. Google Calendar uses buildings as the foundation for all your resources.\nNote: Building addresses are not used\u00a0for map navigation.\n\nAdd a building in the Admin console\n\nYou can create up to 10,000 buildings for your company or in each domain.\nAdd the required fields now. You can come back and fill in the optional fields later.\u00a0\n\nSign in to your Google\u00a0Admin\u00a0console.\nSign in using your administrator account (does not end in @gmail.com).\n\nIn the Admin console, go to Menu\u00a0\u00a0DirectoryBuildings and resources.\n\nIn the Resource management section, click Open.\nAt the bottom of the page, click Manage Buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\nPoint to and click\u00a0Add Add new building.\nEnter the building information.\n  To add the address:\n\nClick\u00a0Edit\u00a0\u00a0 Edit address.\u00a0\n\nEnter the address information for each location using the official postal address format for its region. The Google map panel on the right shows a pin at the address.\u00a0Addresses associated with a known business location will be stored using the local language.\u00a0Note: Building addresses are not used\u00a0for map navigation.\n\nIf needed, drag the pin to the best or correct location. We recommend that you place\u00a0the pin at the center\u00a0of the building's rooftop. The latitude and longitude fields appear.\nClick Done.\u00a0\n\nClick Add\u00a0Building.\n\nAdd buildings in bulk\u00a0\n\nYou can create up to 10,000 buildings for your company or in each domain.\nTo save time, upload all or multiple buildings in your domain.\u00a0\nUpload your spreadsheet\n\nSign in to your Google\u00a0Admin\u00a0console.\nSign in using your administrator account (does not end in @gmail.com).\n\nIn the Admin console, go to Menu\u00a0\u00a0DirectoryBuildings and resources.\n\nIn the Resource management section, click Open.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, click Manage buildings.\n\nPoint to Add\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0click Upload\u00a0\u00a0Bulk upload buildings.\nClick Attach CSV and follow the steps to attach the CSV file.\nClick Upload.\n\nTo view the required fields and descriptions, see below: Format for bulk updates.\n\nUse the API for bulk building updates\u00a0\nFor details, see resources.buildings\u00a0and\u00a0Formats for bulk updates.\n\nStep 2:\u00a0Add audio, video, or other features\nIf you want people to know what equipment or other features come with a room or other resource, add them using the Admin console. For example, you might want to let people know which rooms have a Jamboard, or which company cars have a navigation system.\u00a0\nNote: To add\u00a0features, use the Admin console or API. You can't add features by uploading feature details in a CSV file.\nAdd features one by one in Admin console\n\nYou can create up to 100 features for your company or in each domain.\u00a0\n\nSign in to your Google\u00a0Admin\u00a0console.\nSign in using your administrator account (does not end in @gmail.com).\n\nIn the Admin console, go to Menu\u00a0\u00a0DirectoryBuildings and resources.\n\nIn the Resource management section, click Open.\nClick Manage\u00a0\u00a0Manage resource features.\u00a0\nClick Add\u00a0Feature.\nEnter the feature name and choose the type:\u00a0\n  \nOther: Not videoconferencing or telephony (for example, Whiteboard, Wheelchair accessible, or External guests)\nVideoconferencing: Video communication equipment (for example, VC or Cisco conferencing unit)\nTelephony: Audio communication equipment (for example, phone)\n\nClick Save.\n\nAfter you add a feature, you can add it to a resource by clicking on the resourceFeatures.

If you created features in step 2, you can associate them with the resources as you add them.\u00a0\u00a0\nNote: Resources are typically available within a few minutes of being added. In some cases, however, it might take up to 24 hours for them to become available in everyone's calendar.\nAdd resources one by one in the Admin console\n\nYou can add up to 10,000 resources for your company or in each domain.\u00a0\n\nSign in to your Google\u00a0Admin\u00a0console.\nSign in using your administrator account (does not end in @gmail.com).\n\nIn the Admin console, go to Menu\u00a0\u00a0DirectoryBuildings and resources.\n\nIn the Resource management section, click Open.\nPoint to and click Add\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\nEnter the resource information.
