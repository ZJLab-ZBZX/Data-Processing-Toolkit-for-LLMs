I\u2019m not saying that to be negative. I\u2019m hoping a more honorable gaming company draws some inspiration from SC2 and makes the next hit RTS.\nIf Warcraft 3 Reforged is in indicator of the passion Blizzard puts in it\u2019s games now I think it\u2019s best to put the RTS genre into better hands.\n\n13 Likes\n\nEuRocmi-2687\n\n  March 7, 2020,  1:47pm\n  \n\n9\n\nHatuna\u2019s post is right\u2026 it\u2019s what\u2019s going on w current games (and movies) why flagged.

I\u2019m generally very conservative with changes to the game, and think they should always stick with the T/Z/P races, but this sounds interesting. And very hard to balance indeed.\nThat being said, slim chance we ever see a SC3.\n\n2 Likes\n\nGrumpyMonk-2138181\n\n  March 7, 2020,  7:31pm\n  \n\n12\n\nI would like to see that, other rts devs are so dumb, they can\u2019t even make hotkeys. I longed long time for better RTS game and i saw many, all suck even 10 times harder than SC2 !!! AoE 4 looks promising tho ! Cossacks 3 could have been really really good, but devs mishandled game as usual, because it was small studio.\n\n\u00d0i\u00f3\u0121e\u014bex-2112\n\n  March 7, 2020,  9:22pm\n  \n\n13\n\nSc2 is the last good rts,other games can\u2019t compete against it.Almost no bugs,run on almost any pc,looks good,smooth unit controls\u2026and its free.\n\nDankTemplar-11542\n\n  March 7, 2020, 10:48pm\n  \n\n14\n\nWe won\u2019t see a SC3 made by Blizzard\u2026if we see a SC3 in RTS format, it\u2019ll probably happen after Activision nearly goes bust due to loot box regulation, which will basically take Blizzard down too - at which point there will be an IP sale, someone will buy the StarCraft franchise and attempt to do it justice.\nAll in all, we\u2019re looking at a good 10-20 years before it happens.\n\n3 Likes\n\nCheeseTown-11938\n\n  March 7, 2020, 11:08pm\n  \n\n15\n\nI don\u2019t want to see them make this I would rather them sell it to someone else and give them a go at it.  If they make another rts I want them to do something new/different. They are clearly burnt out and don\u2019t have any new ideas for this series\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nManiac-12435\n\n  March 8, 2020,  2:33am\n  \n\n16\n\nThis has been my hope for sc3, that they would divide each race into different factions, tho I would personally choose them differently from those listed before. It would be difficult to balance, but the meta would be so varied in strategies compared to sc2 it would be insane, in a good way. I do feel like the factions would need to be fleshed out quite a bit compared to co-op, but that\u2019s too be expected.\n\nValon-1967\n\n  March 8, 2020,  3:50am\n  \n\n17\n\nNo, they said the story started in sc 1 ended with legacy of the void. But the world has not ended. Starcraft 3 (when they get around to it as there is no need for sc3 right now) will have the same 3 races.\n\nValon-1967\n\n  March 8, 2020,  3:51am\n  \n\n18\n\nThat\u2019s way too complicated and impossible to balance. More does not mean better. have 3 \u201cfactions\u201d per race would just be a disaster. Save that for co op\n\nPhillox-2189\n\n  March 8, 2020,  8:36am\n  \n\n19\n\nI hope Blizzard will come up with something completely new. Now that Dota, LoL and friends are getting old as well, it is time to merge the classical rts and the moba genre together.\nI see Starcraft 3 as a bigger and better version of C&C Renegade or Battlezone 2 where one player acts is the commander and the other players play as captains. The commander would play in the classical top down perspective, builds a base and an army and gives orders to the captains.\nThose captains play in first or third person. They have a little bit stronger units with special abilities like in a moba, but not so strong that they can wipe out an entire army. Without protection of the lesser \u201cnormal\u201d units they can\u2019t do much.\nFor example if you play as Terran the captains would be Jim Raynor, Tychus or Nova, etc\u2026 the higher tier the commander develops, the better captains you can play. The commander can give units to a captain so he/she forms a squad with those units and lead them to battle.\nWhat I dislike about Starcraft 2 is that the battles are too fast paced, often one battle decides the war and control of ground is not as important as in Broodwar. So for SC3 I hope there will be longer battles waving back and forth, where players try to take control about important areas of the map. In the middle of the battles there would be captains controlled by players with small squads or or even whole armies.\nConcerning the graphics I would like to see a completely three dimensional terrain where units can take proper cover and use high ground, defences and natural barriers to their advantage. To convert the three dimensional maps for the commander, he can only see what his units see. So if a unit is standing in a valley the commander can\u2019t see what is on top of the hills. Or if a units stands in front of a wall the commander doesn\u2019t see whats behind.\nTo get a feeling of how it could be to play one of those captains I think the game Aliens vs Predator 2 is a great example. If Blizzard could combine this kind of gameplay with a modern rts/moba they would create a new era of competitive multiplayer games.\nTo conclude, this would be really fun to play and also epic to watch. Imagine seeing the players fight it out on the small scale and at the same time seeing the whole wide battle field controlled by the commander in the classical starcraft manner.\n\naeligos-1349\n\n  March 8, 2020,  8:41am\n  \n\n20\n\nI sincerely hope a SC3 is not in the works.\nI want, and I think most of us want, SC2 to be continued and supported through eternity.\nIt will never be balanced because our definition of balance differs from that of the devs. And since this is their game, we should accept it and appreciate it for what it is\u2026 the best game in the world.\nI sincerely hope that those involved will continue to support SC2 in this lifetime and the next, and the next, etc\u2026\n\n3 Likes\n\nManiac-12435\n\n  March 8, 2020,  2:41pm\n  \n\n21\n\nI kinda feel like co-op is the \u2018testing grounds\u2019 for faction balancing, so although I agree it would be difficult, I do think they have a better start on it than we give them credit for. I think it\u2019s more a matter of if they want to commit to a SC3 in the first place, whether sooner, later, or never.\n\nHatuna-2180\n\n  March 8, 2020,  4:45pm\n  \n\n22\n\n DankTemplar:\n\nWe won\u2019t see a SC3 made by Blizzard\u2026if we see a SC3 in RTS format, it\u2019ll probably happen after Activision nearly goes bust due to loot box regulation, which will basically take Blizzard down too - at which point there will be an IP sale, someone will buy the StarCraft franchise and attempt to do it justice.\n\nWhat snowflake said  20 characters\n\nnext page \u2192\n\n"}
