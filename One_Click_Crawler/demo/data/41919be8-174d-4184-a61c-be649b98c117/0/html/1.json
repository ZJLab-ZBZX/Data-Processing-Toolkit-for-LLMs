Starcraft 2 is a renowned e-sport this days.Starcraft lore is extensive and super interesting, set approximately 500 years in the future, the StarCraft universe includes three main races. Terrans, a group of humans exiled to the Koprulu sector 200 years ago, the Protoss, a race of humanoid religious warriors with advanced technology, and the Zerg, vile insect-like aliens who share a hive mind.I played singleplayer Starcraft 1 in my young days on old PC intel 133 or what was it called, then again some online Starcraft 2 when it became partially F2P some 10 years ago, but stopped\u00a0due to lack of PC space in my house. I have installed it again on my laptop a couple of months ago, and started playing 1v1's a few weeks back. I'm still unranked, but hopefully that will change soon \u00a0Long story short, i'm quitting this \u300cdookie\u300d show War Robots \u00e3\u0080\u008cfluffernutter\u00e3\u0080\u008d you Pixonic, and if any of you find themself in Starcraft 2 universe, i'm a Terran player ScrapColectr.It's a skill oriented non-stop action game, and stuff top ladder players do is freaking unbelivable, you have to see some of that action\n\nLast Edit: Jun 29, 2021 4:42:55 GMT -5 by \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59\nChef of my wife's kitchen, the builder of my kids gazeebo, the party animalistic, crazy legs, fooze loving almost middle aged child\n\nPoopface\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tModerator \ud83d\udea8\nForum janitorial staff\n\n\r\n\tPosts: 7,289\r\n  Karma: 11,778\r\n\t\r\n\tPilot name: Poopface Too\nPlatform: iOS\nClan: TRMP\nLeague: Champion\nServer Region: North America\n\nStarcraft 2\nJun 29, 2021 10:09:16 GMT -5\n\u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59 likes this\n\nQuote\nSelect PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top\n\nPost by Poopface on Jun 29, 2021 10:09:16 GMT -5\nI loved Starcraft.I really didn't like SC2.\u00a0 I felt like both SC2 and Diablo 3 were just prettied-up versions of their predecessors.\u00a0 I was disappointed in how bad the cameras were.\u00a0 All that said, I'm glad you really enjoy it.\u00a0 I think it's healthy to investigate alternatives to War Robots.\n\nIt's things like this that kept me out of the really good schools.\n\nOliver Kloesov\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tModerator \ud83d\udea8\n\u201cLoki is a huge finger in the face of Newton!\u201d\n\nWITNESS ME!\n\r\n\tPosts: 7,427\r\n  Karma: 13,068\r\n\t\r\n\tPilot name: Oliver Kloesov\nPlatform: iOS\nClan: [NEXT]\nLeague: Champion\nServer Region: North America\nFavorite robot: Phantom\n\nStarcraft 2\nJun 29, 2021 10:19:35 GMT -5\nPoopface and \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59 like this\n\nQuote\nSelect PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top\n\nPost by Oliver Kloesov on Jun 29, 2021 10:19:35 GMT -5\nStarcraft?

With a little C&C and this other one I can't remember what it's called (I remembered:\u00a0 Supreme Commander), thrown in for seasoning.As an adult, I liked Sins of a Solar Empire.  I still load that up and play on Steam every now and again.  The custom battles where you create the Solar Systems and seed the planets and enemies were my thing... some of those would take days to finish, even with a LAN partner on co-op.\n\nLast Edit: Jun 30, 2021 8:17:49 GMT -5 by \u24e3\u24e1\u24d8\u24d2\u24da\u24e848\n46 & 2, just ahead of me.\n\n\u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFenrir\n\nSorry for my bad english, i took a free class in my elementary school\n\r\n\tPosts: 1,523\r\n  Karma: 2,795\r\n\t\r\n\tPilot name: \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59\nPlatform: Android\nClan: O\u029f\u1d05 F\u1d00\u0280\u1d1b\ua731 [F\u1d00\u0280\u1d1b] id:215649\nLeague: Expert\nServer Region: Europe\nFavorite robot: Ghost Rog\n\nStarcraft 2\nJul 12, 2021 16:30:48 GMT -5\n\u00a0\n\nQuote\nSelect PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top\n\nPost by \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59 on Jul 12, 2021 16:30:48 GMT -5\nSo anyways, after 15 qualify games, unranked ones, StarCraft MM placed me into silver leagues division 2 at 1050ish points, they call it MMR.Those unranked games were really something, just like War Robots mm, you literally play vs everything there is out there, had some encounters with really high league players, who were toying with me, my dry aged brain, and my squashed frogs reflexes... Also there were games with people who probably never played RTS before...Now mm seems reasonable, my games last more than 30 minutes in average, and i think and feel like I'm in the right place. I'm still loosing majority of my games, but after watching replays of my games, i can see my opponent, without fog of war, and in many of those losses, i had one or more opportunities to win.I also suck big time in the late game, get lost in lower tech tree than my opponent and usually get overun by higher tech army, no tactics, just huge steam roller. Even though I dominated the game in it's early and mid stages... That's something that's telling me that I'm not playing vs players more experienced than me, it's just that they focused on different things, building 20 battle cruisers and just rain death upon my poor and weathered early game marines In my league I'm yet to see a player playing any race that's not Terran, which sucks, but that's just the way it is in the noob league over here \n\nChef of my wife's kitchen, the builder of my kids gazeebo, the party animalistic, crazy legs, fooze loving almost middle aged child\n\n\u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tFenrir\n\nSorry for my bad english, i took a free class in my elementary school\n\r\n\tPosts: 1,523\r\n  Karma: 2,795\r\n\t\r\n\tPilot name: \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59\nPlatform: Android\nClan: O\u029f\u1d05 F\u1d00\u0280\u1d1b\ua731 [F\u1d00\u0280\u1d1b] id:215649\nLeague: Expert\nServer Region: Europe\nFavorite robot: Ghost Rog\n\nStarcraft 2\nJul 29, 2021 9:43:04 GMT -5\n\u00a0\n\nQuote\nSelect PostDeselect PostLink to PostMemberGive GiftBack to Top\n\nPost by \u4e43\u3125\u5342\u4e59 on Jul 29, 2021 9:43:04 GMT -5\nSo, StarCraft 2 right...Started playing Protoss at the start of new season, totally cool race! And somehow, at the start of new season, i got promoted to Master league... Which is really confusing, because, one step up, there's Grandmaster league, and that's the home of pro players, top leauge that is. Probably a bug, because i still play against silver league players... Or just maybe I'm that awesome!Whatever the case, it's cool to have a glowing star by my name \n\nChef of my wife's kitchen, the builder of my kids gazeebo, the party animalistic, crazy legs, fooze loving almost middle aged child\n\nReply\n\n"}
