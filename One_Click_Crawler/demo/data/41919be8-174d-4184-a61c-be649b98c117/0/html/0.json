Is there such a model that makes one race superior over another? An example would be Terran is better than Zerg which is better than Protoss which beats Terran again.\nIf you grew up playing Pokemon, this is similar to the type of Pokemon you start out with, fire, water, grass.  To apply it to Starcraft 2, we may consider a firebat to be \"fire\", a zergling to be \"grass\" and a zealot to be \"water\".  Firebats might win against zerglings, zerglings would be able to swarm zealots, and zealots would just out damage the firebat...\nIn your experience of the game, have you seen this to exist?\n\nstarcraft-2\n\nShare\n\nImprove this question\n\n  Follow\n  \n\nedited Mar 14, 2013 at 14:03\n\nFalcon165o\n\n1,80211 gold badge1313 silver badges3131 bronze badges\n\n  asked Mar 13, 2013 at 15:44\n\nponsfonzeponsfonze\n\n1,13155 gold badges1212 silver badges1919 bronze badges\n\n12\n\n1\n\nNo.  It's all skill based.\n\n\u2013\u00a0Frank\n\nCommented\nMar 13, 2013 at 15:49\n\n2\n\nThis is pure discussion, not a good fit for the site.\n\n\u2013\u00a0Matthew Read\n\nCommented\nMar 13, 2013 at 16:02\n\n7\n\nI disagree that this is pure discussion. I believe it is a fair question to ask if the races are intended to be evenly matched, or if there is a built in advantage/disadvantage to certain matchups. Certainly many who play will have this question - and I believe it is answerable with a wealth of balancing details provided by Blizz.\n\n\u2013\u00a0EBongo\n\nCommented\nMar 13, 2013 at 16:29\n\n2\n\n@EBongo Looking at Starcraft as a Rock Paper Scissors type of model will automatically introduce logical fallacies when choosing your opposing race.  And then we get questions like, \"WTF!  Zerg beats Terran!  Why didn't I win?\".  Maybe slightly related, something like this is much better.\n\n\u2013\u00a0Frank\n\nCommented\nMar 13, 2013 at 17:18\n\n3\n\nI'm arguing against the inherently discussion based question.  It's completely non-constructive because it introduces a false model as part of the question.  The only way TO answer that is, \"No\".  And questions where all you can answer is No, is a bad question. @EBongo\n\n\u2013\u00a0Frank\n\nCommented\nMar 13, 2013 at 23:35\n\n\u00a0|\u00a0\nShow 7 more comments\n\n  2 Answers\n  2\n\n  Sorted by:\n  \n\n  Reset to default\n  \n\n  Highest score (default)\n  \n\n  Date modified (newest first)\n  \n\n  Date created (oldest first)\n  \n\n  6\n  \n\nFor the moment, the \"OP\" units (though not game breaking) seem to be the Hellbats and the Tempest. I really feel that it's because they are new and people haven't found a good way to fight them yet (for the same reason voidray collossus was \"OP\" until zerg found out about fungal growth).\nStarcraft 2 is made to be a competitive game, so all races have to be able to play against all races. Blizzard wants most unit in each race arsenal to have a role in most matchups. That is why the changed the reapers in HoTS, that is why the hydras got buffed and that is why the voidrays got changed too.\ntldr; no, nothing is game breaking otherwise sc2 would be boring. Blizzard said the mathchups win/loss were pretty close in pro matches in a statement last week about game balance. They know about skytoss but they want to wait before doing any changes.\nEDIT: I saw in the comments of the question that sources were asked, so i started doing some ressearch to help with my claims.\nCharts of the win/loss:\nhttp://www.sc2charts.net/en/edb\nIntwerview with Dustin Browder by Frodan: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=382616\nrace distribution:http://www.sc2ranks.com/stats/league/all/1/all/0/0/0\nIAMA with blizz dev team: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/8983614/Reddit_AMA_Full_Transcript-3_6_2013\nbalance report just before HoTS release: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/8896362/Situation_Report_Heart_of_the_Swarm_Balance-3_4_2013\nThese are the stats I could find for now.\nThe race distribution is in WoL because Sc2 ranks have not updated their database with enough HoTS players for it to be reliable for now. Like it has been said in the comments, the balance of the races is a lot about skills (which is why it is so hard to do a perfect balance).\nWhen you lose a game, check the replay, how many workers did you have, what were your upgrades, what was the angle of attack, did your opponent hide expos or tech, etc.\n\nShare\n\nImprove this answer\n\n  Follow\n  \n\nedited Mar 13, 2013 at 17:11\n\n  answered Mar 13, 2013 at 15:54\n\nHugo TrudelHugo Trudel\n\n1,7491111 silver badges1919 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment\n\u00a0|\u00a0\n\n  3\n  \n\nNo. Races aren't build with rock, paper, scissors model but their units have this \"model\".\nIf you see at this Zealot wiki page he is Strong Against; Marauder, Immortal, Zergling\nand Weak Against; Hellion, Colossus, Roach.\nTo win games you need know how to build your race to make your army strong against enemy.\n\nShare\n\nImprove this answer\n\n  Follow\n  \n\n  answered Mar 14, 2013 at 9:19\n\niberiber\n\n5,8081515 gold badges4343 silver badges7171 bronze badges\n\nAdd a comment\n\u00a0|\u00a0\n\n  You must log in to answer this question.\n  \n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
