The regulations that apply to the size of these structures were updated in 2024.\u00a0As of April 9, 2024, attached accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are allowed to be constructed either within or as an addition to single-unit detached homes, if certain conditions are met.The Mayor and Council are considering amendments to the Zoning Ordinance that would revise the regulations to allow ADUs in accessory buildings, known as detached ADUs, as a conditional use in residential zones. An overview of existing regulations and the proposed zoning amendment is provided below.An accessory building is a detached structure in the rear yard, such as a shed or garage.An attached accessory dwelling unit (or accessory apartment) is a secondary living unit enclosed within or attached to a single-unit detached house. Examples include a basement conversion or home addition that contains an independent dwelling unit.A detached accessory dwelling unit is a secondary living unit on the same property as a single-unit detached house. Examples include an apartment over a detached garage or a smaller structure (on a foundation) in the backyard.Learn more about how to submit a development application.\n\n \n \n\nStill have questions?

Accessory buildings taller than 12 feet must be set back an additional 3 feet for each additional foot of height, up to 15 feet. Accessory buildings may exceed 15 feet in height, up to a maximum of 20 feet, with no additional setback required.Height is measured to the peak of the roof of an accessory building. In addition, accessory building heights are measured from the lowest point of the finished grade rather than at the front of the building.The height of any accessory building may not exceed the height of the main dwelling.Accessory Building AreaThe maximum footprint (i.e., area on the ground) for any one accessory building is 750 square feet and cannot exceed the footprint of the main building. The maximum footprint of all accessory buildings on a single lot is 1,000 square feet.The maximum rear yard building coverage is 15% in R-150, R-200, and R-400 zones and 25% in all other residential zones.Accessory Building SetbacksA minimum requirement of 3 feet of building setback is required from any lot line, with additional setbacks required for accessory buildings taller than 12 feet.Review the full regulations for accessory buildings and structures in the Zoning Ordinance.Regulations for Attached Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) (Effective April 9, 2024)The Mayor and Council passed a zoning text amendment (TXT2023-00263) on Oct. 9, 2023, to allow attached ADUs as a conditional use in residential zones.This legislation went into effect on April 9, 2024. Homeowners who wish to either build an attached ADU under the new regulations or bring an existing attached ADU into compliance may begin the application process, which requires approval.\u00a0Attached ADU RegulationsDesign requirements: The attached ADU must have a separate entrance. Any external modifications to the single-unit detached home must be compatible with the existing dwelling and any neighborhood design guidelines.Owner occupancy: The property owner must occupy either the main building or the attached ADU for at least six months of the year.Size: The gross floor area of the attached ADU must be equal to or less than 50% of the total floor area of the primary dwelling, unless the attached ADU is located in the basement or cellar, in which case it may equal the square footage of the basement or cellar.Parking: Lots with attached ADUs that require modifications to the exterior of the existing building (for example, a home addition) must have two off-street parking spaces unless located within 7/10th of a mile walking distance to a Metro station, in which case the lot must have at least one off-street parking space. Applicants may seek a waiver from this requirement from the Chief of Zoning. Lots with attached ADUs that do not require modifications to the exterior of the existing building (for example, a basement conversion) are not required to provide off-street parking spaces.Review the full future regulations of attached ADUs in the approved Zoning Text Amendment.Grace Period for Existing Unpermitted Attached ADUsIf you have an attached ADU in your home that has not been previously approved by the city, you are now able to apply for approval. Conditional use approval must be received by April 9, 2025 \u2013 after that date, this clause will no longer be in effect and any unpermitted attached ADU will constitute a violation. All applications from existing attached ADUs received during this grace period will need to conform with the regulations listed above, except for the gross floor area requirements.Public Input Sought on Proposed Revisions to Regulations for Detached Accessory Dwelling UnitsThe Mayor and Council is seeking feedback on the proposed text amendment (TXT2019-00255) to allow a detached ADU on the same lot as a single-unit detached home. In addition to the requirements for accessory buildings, as described above, detached ADUs would be subject to other requirements, including a maximum gross floor area restriction of 50% of the gross floor area of the main home or 750 square feet, whichever is less. Detached ADUs would not be permitted on a property that already has an attached ADU.The Planning Commission held a public hearing for this proposal on May 10, 2023 and made recommendations to the Mayor and Council at its July 12, 2023 meeting. The Mayor and Council will hold a public hearing on June 3, 2024 and consider Planning Commission and staff recommendations, and community feedback at a future meeting. Community Planning and Development Services staff are available to answer questions through virtual meetings, by email or over the phone, as requested.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nZoning Code Amendments\n\nZoning Interpretations\n\nAccessory Buildings, Structures, and Dwellings\n\n \n\n \n\nBids\n\nPay Tickets\n\nPay Water\n\nRecreation Registration\n\nPermits\n\nJobs\n\nDonate\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nJobs\n\nVolunteer\n\nPolicies\n\nAccessibility\n\nContact Us\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nStay up to date with what's happening in your city.\nJoin\n\n \n\n  \n \n\nReport a concern\n\nGive Feedback\n\nAsk a question\n\nSign up for alerts\n\n \n \n\nCity of Rockville\n\r\n111 Maryland Avenue\r\nRockville, MD 20850\n\r\nPhone:\u00a0 240-314-5000\n \n\n  \n \n \n\n \n \n\nHome\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCopyright Notices\n\nEmployee Resources\n\nSite Map\n\n/QuickLinks.aspx\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nDelicious\nBlogger\nLinkedIn\n\n \n \n\nHome\nMy Account\nPrinter Friendly\nEmail Page\nContact Us\nHear This Page\nRSS\nSite Map\nDocuments\nHelp\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nLoading\n\n\r\n\tLoading\r\n\t\n\nDo Not Show Again\nClose\n\nArrow Left\n\nArrow Right\n\n[]\n\nSlideshow Left Arrow\n\nSlideshow Right Arrow\n\n"}
