All settings you make in the Admin console apply to this top-level organizational unit and, therefore, to all users and devices in your account.\nApply settings to groups of users or devices\n To apply different settings to some users or devices, place them in a child organizational unit, (for example, Finance or Human Resources) below the top level. Users or devices in organizational units get the settings that you apply to them. To keep a child organizational unit from inheriting its parent\u2019s settings, apply to the child any settings that are specific to it.\n\nExample\u2014Gmail, Google Meet, and Google Drive work for users in the top-level organizational unit. Users in the child organizational unit inherit Gmail and Drive, but for them, Meet is off.\nRecommendation\u2014Create separate organizational units for users and devices. That way, you can tailor settings for managed devices and managed users as needed.\n\nSet up your organizational structure\nBelow the top-level unit, you can add child organizational units\u2014either at the same level or in a hierarchy. When you change a setting at a higher level, the settings for all child organizational units that inherit that setting also change. Custom settings, however, remain unchanged.\u00a0\nTo get started:\n\nCreate organizational units that contain users or Chrome devices.\nFor each organizational unit, you can:\n  \nTurn services on or off for\u00a0users \u00a0\nChange service settings, such as Drive sharing policies\nSet\u00a0policies for Chrome devices\n\nApply settings to one user or device\nTo change settings for a single user or device, create an organizational unit for just that user or device. A user or device belongs to only one organizational unit and inherits that organizational unit's settings.\nIf you use multiple domains\nYou can mix and match users from all your domains in an organizational unit. To change settings for users in a particular domain, create an organizational unit for just those users.\nOptions for large organizations\nIf you manage a large number of users or sync your LDAP directory, you might want to make exceptions for some groups of users, regardless of their organizational unit.\u00a0\nYou have 2 options:\n\nConfiguration groups (to customize\u00a0service settings)\u2014For example, you might prevent external sharing of Drive files for people in entire departments using organizational units. Then allow sharing externally\u00a0for selective people within each department by placing those individuals in a configuration group.\n\n  For steps:\u00a0Customize service settings using\u00a0configuration groups\n\nAccess groups (to customize\u00a0service access)\u2014For example, you might turn off YouTube for people in entire departments using organizational units. Then turn on YouTube for selective people within each department by placing them in an access\u00a0group.\n  For steps:\u00a0Customize service access using\u00a0access groups\n\n  Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit  Need more help?
