I've got only an avocational code interpretation background, but I'm learning a lot in our present endeavor.\n\nMy wife and I are planning to build our own home in Pennsylvania to be closer to her family in NJ. Wisconsin is just too far away. We are planning a home in an area zoned \"Land Conservation\" in a rural county, which seemed to provide the most flexibility for what we wanted to do.\n\nThe county zoning official says that I can't put up and use ANY structure prior to a certificate of occupancy on the primary dwelling unit. No storage building. No chicken coop for our chickens. No place to lock up a skid-steer or tractor. He said the restriction was an underlying condition in the zoning category, but I can't find it anywhere in the zoning ordinance. \n\nIronically, if it weren't for pesky deed restrictions, neither the county zoning nor township ordinances preclude living in a tent after getting a permit for a portable toilet, and the sewage officer is happy to issue such a permit. Deed restrictions also prohibit mobile homes.\n\nThis puts a real dent in our plans, to the point where my wife is looking to relocate to another county? state? without such restrictions. It looks like we would have to rent a dwelling and storage unit in town. It also makes it difficult to source recycled building materials, which is one of our goals. \n\nBy the way, we haven't committed legally to buying any parcel, although we do have a verbal offer in on one that we really like. We haven't found another suitable property without deed restrictions against mobile homes or with a dwelling we can occupy.\n\nMy questions:\n\nHow pervasive is this requirement, in Pennsylvania, elsewhere?\n\nWhere is it found in code/ordinance/regulations?\n\nDo I have a snowball's chance in {climate change} to get a variance around this?\n\nAny suggestions on how we can transition to this area more easily?\n\nThanks,\n\nDave\n\n\u00a0\n\nmjesse\nBRONZE MEMBER\n\nJoined\nOct 19, 2009\n\nMessages\n987\n\nLocation\n\nLincolnshire, IL.\n\nFirst, Welcome to THE forum.\n\nWe have similar Zoning laws on the books here.\n\nYour chances of getting around it here would be next to none.\n\nHave you considered buying a property with an existing house (to live in) while you build your new home on the same lot?\n\nBest of luck, and keep on posting here.\n\nmj\n\n\u00a0\n\nR\n\nrighter101\nGold Member\n\nJoined\nDec 5, 2009\n\nMessages\n604\n\nWe had this issue with a past planning director (In our jurisdiction, planning and building are a merged department).  The director denied a few permits for accessory structures prior to house construction.  The people went to the council and got a different ruling.\n\nThe director is since gone, and we have the following policy in place.  Keep in mind though, that it only deals with the building code.  Zoning is a whole nother animal.\n\nWe are a very beautiful and rural county in western Washington and while we do enforce zoing and building codes, a lot of folks come here to get away from the mainland life.  (San Juan County, Washington.  170+ islands, 18,000 people, no bridge or road to get here.  No traffic lights on any of the islands.)\n\nI would ask them specifically for the ordinanace they are citing or relying on for this authority. Also, if they won't give you that, you could apply for a dwelling (single family residence) permit and insulate it and show a basic kitchen and call that the dwelling, then when you are ready to build your house, they will tell you you can not have 2 dwellings, so you agree to remove the kitchen.  We have folks do that to avoid violating density, but we allow construction of accessory structures first..\n\nThere are ways to work within the rules, however, cost may become an issue.  Good luck.  Thanks for asking questions.\n\nHERE IS OUR POLICY\n\nISSUE:  Are non-habitable structures customarily considered accessory structures to residential dwelling units allowed to be permitted, inspected, or constructed under the provisions of the International Residential Code (IRC) prior to the permitting and construction of the principle structure to which they are accessory to?\n\nANALYSIS:\n\nApplicable Code Sections:\n\n\u2022\tSection R101.2 of the International Residential Code (IRC) limits the scope of the IRC to One- and Two-family Dwellings and their accessory structures.\n\n\u2022\tSection R202 of the IRC defines an \u201cAccessory Structure\u201d as \u201c. . . A structure not greater than 3,000 square feet (279 m2) in floor area, and not over two stories in height, the use of which is customarily accessory to and incidental to that of the dwelling(s) and which is located on the same lot.\n\n\u2022\tSection R101.3 of the IRC and 101.3 of the International Building Code (IBC) further limits the purpose of the IRC to the establishment of the \u201cminimum\u201d requirements necessary to safeguard the public safety, health and general welfare.\n\n\u2022\tSection R104.1 of the IRC and Section 104.1 of IBC provide that the building official has the authority to render interpretations of this code and to adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions; provided that such interpretations, policies and procedures are in conformance with the intent and purpose of the codes and do not waive requirements specifically provided for in the codes.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nFrom Section R101.2 of the IRC and the Definition of Accessory Structure of Section R202 of the IRC it is clear that the primary or principal building legally exists prior to the legal existence of an accessory structure.  This would not preclude the concurrent application, permitting, and approval of a principal dwelling unit and its accessory structures, however, this would not allow the final approval of the accessory structures prior to the final approval for occupancy of the primary residence.\n\nHowever, it is not uncommon for an owner to want to construct non-habitable structures for his/her private and personal use prior to the construction of the primary dwelling.  Such non-habitable structures are generally intended for limited private agricultural purposes or for the storage and securing of materials, equipment and/or tools and may be desired to facilitate the future construction of the primary residence or to facilitate the seasonal or recreational use of the property.\n\nIf these structures can not be built as accessory structures under the IRC, then they might be built under the provision of the IBC as Group U Occupancies (per Section 312.1) or as Group U\u2013Agricultural Buildings (per Appendix C).\n\nWhere the only issue is sequencing of permitting and construction and not increased hazards of use or design, the County might be applying unreasonable and unnecessary requirements if it required these structures to be built under the more restrictive provisions of the IBC.  It could also be argued that enforcing the IBC provisions on these structures could be violating the intent of the codes to only apply the \u201cminimum\u201d requirements (per Sections R101.3 of the IRC and 101.3 of the IBC) necessary to safeguard the public safety, health and general welfare.\n\nIt might be appropriate to apply the provisions of the IRC on these structures where the following conditions apply and the only issue is sequencing of permitting and construction:\n\n\u2022\tSuch structures comply with the design parameters of IRC Accessory Structures, and\n\n\u2022\tThe intended uses of the structures are similar to those normally anticipated with IRC Accessory Structures, and\n\n\u2022\tCould be considered an extension of and accessory to a remote or distant primary residential structure.\n\nPOLICY:  Pursuant to Section R104.1 of the IRC and Section 104.1 of IBC, Non-habitable Structures may be constructed under the provisions of the IRC prior to the construction of the primary residence where the following apply:\n\n1.\tThe Structure could be permitted as a Group U Occupancy under the IBC; and\n\n2.\tThe Structure is clearly intended for private, personal or agricultural use (public use, commercial use, home occupations, or cottage industries are not allowed under this provision), and\n\n3.\tThe Structure is not greater than 3,000 square feet (279 m2) in floor area, and not over two stories in height,\n\n4.\tThe Structure complies with all other San Juan County rules and regulations including, but not limited to, land use regulations and applicable construction code requirements.\n\nThis policy does not waive or modify other applicable requirements, such as but not limited to shoreline provisions, which may be more restrictive.\n\nWhere special conditions exist, the Director or Deputy Director/Chief Building Official shall be permitted to approve modifications to this policy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nfatboy\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\nOct 17, 2009\n\nMessages\n6,855\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern CO\n\nWelcome to the forum aardvark, hopefully we can help in your current project.\n\nAs far as Zoning requirements, they vary SO much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nAfter trying to figure out Planners for 14 years, (humph, good luck with that) I could imagine the thinking being they don't want a bunch of properties that only have chicken coops, sheds, shops, etc. without a primary structure to justify them.

In the case of lumber if the recycled lumber does not have a grade stamp then hire a certified lumber grader to grade the lumber.  Once the lumber is graded there is no difference between new lumber and recycled lumber.\n\nI could argue that all lumber is recycled from its original use as part of a tree.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1\n2\n\nNext\n\n\t1 of 2\n\t\n\nGo to page\n\nGo\n\n\tNext \n\n Last\n\n\tYou must log in or register to reply here.\n\t\n\nShare:\n\nFacebook\n\n X (Twitter)\n\nReddit\n\nPinterest\n\nTumblr\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nShare\n\nLink\n\nForums\n\nAdditional Codes\n\nPlanning and Zoning Ordinances and Codes\n\n \n\nTop\n\n"}
