A part of a series on what to know in the very beginning of your Starcraft career. \nWhen you first begin to play Starcraft 2 against other human beings one thing will almost always happen; you will feel that the game is pretty clear cut. Starcraft is just about who has the better units or who can play faster right? The truth is Starcraft is just like many other learning experiences, the more you learn the more you realise there is to know.\n\u201cStarcraft 2 is just like many other learning experiences, the more you learn, the more you realise there is to know.\u201d\nOnce I started to realise the scope of what there is to understand about this game I felt utterly lost. I had played a few other strategy games before I played SC2 but I had never ventured below the surface of these games, and when it happened with SC2 I knew that I wanted to learn everything but I had no idea where to begin.\nChances are if you are reading this post you are just starting to realise that there is a lot more to this game than you first thought. The question of \u201cwhat are the crucial first things to learn?\u201d has been bothering me for many months now, but I think I have finally got it down.\nThis series of articles (The Very Beginning) will be about those things which I have discovered were the most important things to learn in the very beginning. The first thing I will be looking at and the first thing you should learn about is the Races. This article will also talk about picking your race.\n\nStarcraft 2\u2019s Races\nFirst of all, in Starcraft 2 there are three races; Terran, Protoss and Zerg. Right you already knew that but the important thing is actually the differences between them. It is important to note that no one race is better than the others, nor is any race easier to learn. But they are all very different and you may find that you prefer the way one race plays over the others.\n\u201cNo one race is better than the others, nor is any race easier to learn.\u201d\nA very general description would see us describe the three races in the following way:\n\nTerran\nTerran is seen as the most resourceful race, they have many tactical options available to them and can come back from the brink of a loss if the opponent does not completely destroy them. As mankind is known for utilising their surroundings to their fullest advantage so to do Terran. On the scale of troop numbers to troop survivability Terran are the middle ground with a good number of fairly survivable units.\nPlanetary Fortress are the best defensive building in the game, especially when combined with the repair ability of the SCV.\n \nMain features of Terran:\n\nThe ability to wall of \u00a0ramps or choke points with buildings that can either lift off or submerge to allow units to pass.\nThe ability for most buildings to lift off and fly to a new location make them able to relocate to a new base or tactical position with ease.\nSCV\u2019s can repair buildings and mechanical units. This feature allows for easier defence as well as the ability to maintain an aggressive mechanical army.\nFree bunkers. Bunkers can be salvaged for a refund of their cost price. As such, they can be used defensively and aggressively with little economic risk.\nPlanetary fortress are an extremely powerful defensive option and are even better when combined with SCV\u2019s repair ability.\nCloaked helicopters. Need I say any more?\n\nProtoss\nProtoss is an advanced and ancient race but their numbers are few. They make up for this by being the sturdiest of the three races and also by having an excellent selection of support units. This combination often sees deceptively small forces of Protoss units overcome much larger armies.\nForcefields can turn the tide of a battle for Protoss.\nMain features of Protoss:\n\nBuildings warp in rather than build. A Probe need only start the Warp-in process after which they can move on to another task. This feature means that can a single Probe can set up an entire base very quickly.\nA selection of Protoss\u2019 units can be warped in almost instantly anywhere a power grid exists (created by Pylons and Warp Prisms). This means that a large defensive army can be raised instantly or that an attacking army can be easily reinforced. Warping in of units can also be used to sneakily bypass opponents defensive forces.\nAll Protoss units and structures have a\u00a0good selection of Psionic abilities such as forcefields can change the course of any battle.\nLasers are cool!\n\nZerg\nZerg is a race of insect like units that are controlled by a single mind entity. Zerg units are individually fragile but they more than make up for this with far greater numbers than the other races. If you are precious with your units Zerg is not for you.\u00a0Zerg players are well known to expand, surround and chip away at the enemy army until an opening in their defences is found at which point they flood in and devour everything.\nAttacks from a Nydus Worm can end the game for an unprepared enemy.\nMain features of Zerg:\n\nLarvae system see multiple units able to spawn at the same time. Because of this it is possible for Zerg to replenish its forces almost as quickly as they are killed.\nMany units can burrow underground and some can even tunnel allowing for the repositioning of units and giving them the ability to carry out a surprise attack after which they can re-burrow and tunnel away.\nNydus Network allows for entire armies to enter a giant worm at one end and exit at another end anywhere the Zerg player has vision. Using this an army can even be released in the back of your opponents base, attack, and when defensive forces arrive the army can retreat to the safety of the network. This mechanic easily makes Zerg the most mobile race.\nZerg players are arguably the most badass of Starcraft 2 players.\n\nSelecting Which Race to Play\nSelecting your race can be difficult, so just pick which you think is the coolest!\nChoosing one race to stick with is advisable at the beginner level, specialising in this way allows you to learn moreabout\u00a0your race and how it plays. After you are confident with one race you may wish to learn another or to play random, but in the beginning pick just one. But how do you make this decision, what if you end up hating the race?\nWell, the first thing to remember is your choice is not permanent. If you do want to learn another race at a later date you can easily do it and what you learned with your first race is not wasted. On the contrary, it gives you a deeper understanding of that race\u2019s strengths and weaknesses which will benefit you when you play against them.\nI recommend that you just pick your first race purely based on which one you think is the coolest, which one you think suits your personality the most or which one you think will be most fun to play. After all you want to identify with your race choice and to have fun with it.\nWhich race did you choose? If you have already decided how did you come to that decision?

I originally picked Terran, following on from the campaign option and SC1.\nHowever, unlike SC1, protoss seem more mobile than terran; and using warps, are able to quickly reinforce for critical moments of play.  I have switched to protoss and am glad I did.\nOn the same token, I still play terran (and zerg) a little, to keep in the loop about how my opponents think!\nGL with the site and GG to all!\n\n \nReply \nZiggyD\n\nin January 31st, 2011 @ 16:37\n\nThanks heaps for the comment and the feedback!\nI am mostly playing protoss now as well and I do think their mobility is great. I usually like to play a more mobile game so blink stalkers and warp prisms really suit me well.\nIt is a good idea to check out the other races with a few games here and there, really gives you a feel for their strengths and weaknesses.\nMy next article is ready to go, but unfortunately WordPress is on the fritz. Hopefully I can get it sorted asap and get back to work!\n\n \nReply \nWildBoarUA\n\nin July 19th, 2011 @ 09:00\n\nNice article, but i think you were not very analyze-oriented while telling about main features, some of the described ones are pretty general, but some are way too narrow. IMO its better to say that Terran may build wherever they want(not on creep, of course), Protoss \u2013 inside energy field and Zergs \u2013 only on creep, nevermind who is owner of it. Terran may heal all his units and buildings \u2013 using medivacs for infantry and SCV\u2019s for all mech, even in battle, Protoss heals only shields, fast enough but only slightly after or between battles(well, Medivacs and SCV\u2019s of ally may still heal hit points) and Zerg units do heal all the time by themselves. Supplies are enlarged by different structures with different abilities \u2013 Terran\u2019s can open/close themselves, Protoss\u2019 give energy field to warp in units and buildings and provide energy for buildings\u2019 fuinctioning and Zerg\u2019s are actually units, that can fly and have a list of different options on usage. All three races have different upgrade split \u2013 Terran can upgrade Infantry/Land Tech/Air tech Attack/Armor independently, Protoss\u2019 upgrades are split to Land/Air Attack/Armor and Shields and Zerg\u2019s \u2013 Melee/Range(Land)/Air Attack, Land/Air Armor. Both Terran and Protoss need to construct lots of different buildings to create a lot of units simultaneously(which come from them or can be warped in energy field), while Zerg\u2019s units come from main building and he needs only 1 Structure more to open new type of units available to create.\nKinda like that ) Still, nice article, good job )\n\n \nReply \nWildBoarUA\n\nin July 19th, 2011 @ 09:06\n\nOops, i forgot really crucial feature \u2013 Terrans do create buildings with SCV\u2019s that can get back to mining after building a structure, Protosses do warp them, and Zerg buildings are alive and morph from a Drone, that cant get back to work after morphing )\n\n \nReply \nZiggyD\n\nin July 19th, 2011 @ 17:06\n\n\ud83d\ude00 Thanks for the in depth comment and feedback WildBoar. \nI kept this article pretty analysis free and general as I was only in Bronze at the time of writing! I wanted to give a bit of an overview of some interesting features without too much analysis to help people decide on which race to start playing when they begin.\nI would encourage anyone still having trouble deciding which race to play to read WildBoar\u2019s points as they are all quite important and affect the way you play each race.\nThe most important thing is that you simply start playing, you can always try another race later!\n\n \nReply \nWildBoarUA\n\nin July 19th, 2011 @ 17:50\n\nYeah, i started with Terran and then understood that it\u2019s not my race, so i switched to Zerg and now i feel comfortable and cool ) Thinking about switching to Random to help myself discover all the valuable info about all three races )\n\n \nReply \nZiggyD\n\nin July 19th, 2011 @ 18:06\n\nI did that and I recommend it! I talk a bit about my experience with random in this article http://learningsc2.com/news/progress/\nPlaying random helped me decide on which race was my best fit as well as helping me learn a lot about the game. \n\nBack to Top\nLearningSC2.com Copyright 2011 ZiggyD\n\n"}
